            This hackathon will be held exclusively online using GitHub and
            Google Meet. There will be a general room where all the information
            sessions will be held as well as breakout rooms for the individual
            teams. Coaches and mentors will also be available during scheduled
            time frames where teams can pose questions.</font

            Yes, you sure can. Not a problem! Normally, if not all, most people
            have zero experience in their first hack. It’s entirely irrelevant
            what your experience is going into a hackathon, it’s more about your
            interest in technology. Every Member should be passionate about
            making hackathons a great learning and memorable experience.</font

            Yes, absolutely. We welcome all skill sets and all stages of
            development –from zero to running start-up. It’s our job to see how
            teams progress and judge fairly. Anyhow it will be great to have a

            everyone can learn something new!</font
